## 🗄️ Database Design

### 🧱 Key Entities & Relationships

| Entity | Fields | Relationships |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **👤 User** | `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`, `date_joined` | A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings. |
| **🏡 Property** | `id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location`, `host_id` | Each property belongs to a host (user) and can have many bookings and reviews. |
| **🧾 Booking** | `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status` | Each booking is linked to one property and one user. |
| **⭐ Review** | `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `date_created` | Each review belongs to one user and one property. |
| **💳 Payment** | `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `method`, `status`, `created_at` | Each payment is associated with one booking. |

### 🔗 Entity Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking**.

## 🔐 API Security

| Security Measure | Description | Importance |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **🔑 Authentication (JWT/OAuth2)** | Verifies user identity before granting access to protected endpoints. | Protects user accounts and sessions. |
| **🧾 Authorization** | Controls access based on user roles (guest, host, admin). | Prevents unauthorized actions. |
| **🧼 Input Validation** | Sanitizes all inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks. | Keeps database and users safe. |
| **🚦 Rate Limiting** | Restricts API request frequency per IP. | Prevents abuse and denial-of-service attacks. |
| **🔒 Data Encryption (HTTPS)** | Encrypts sensitive data in transit and at rest. | Secures user info and payments. |

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **🔁 Continuous Integration (CI)** | Automatically tests and builds new code whenever changes are committed. |
| **🚚 Continuous Deployment (CD)** | Automatically deploys verified builds to production environments. |
| **🧰 Tools Used** | **GitHub Actions** for automation, **Docker** for containerization, **AWS/Render/Vercel** for deployment. |

### 💡 Why It Matters
- ✅ Faster, more reliable releases  
- 🧩 Automated testing reduces human error  
- 🌍 Consistent development-to-deployment workflow
